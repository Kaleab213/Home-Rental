# Home-Rental

I have developed a comprehensive full stack website for a home rental system. This platform enables tenants to create profiles and list their available rental properties. They have the option to upload images, provide descriptions, specify rental rates, and share their contact information so that interested subtenants can easily get in touch with them.

On the other hand, subtenants can create their own profiles and browse through the available rental properties. They can utilize search filters to refine their search based on factors such as location, price, and size. Once they find a suitable property, they can directly contact the tenant using the provided contact information to arrange viewings or discuss further details.

The website serves as an intermediary, connecting tenants and subtenants by facilitating the exchange of contact information. Essentially, it acts as a mediator, streamlining and simplifying the rental process.

To enhance security, the website incorporates authentication mechanisms such as username and password login. Additionally, I have implemented a rating and review system, allowing users to express their opinions about the rental properties. This feature is particularly beneficial for other subtenants, as it provides valuable insights and feedback.

In terms of user interface, the website boasts a user-friendly and intuitive design. It features a clean and modern layout that enables seamless navigation through its various functionalities. I have utilized visually appealing colors, icons, and graphics to create an engaging and aesthetically pleasing website.

In summary, my home rental system website offers a convenient and efficient platform for tenants and subtenants to connect and simplify the rental process. It ensures security through authentication mechanisms, incorporates a rating and review system, and provides an appealing user interface for an enjoyable user experience.
